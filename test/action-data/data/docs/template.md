# Testing

`mocha`, `chai`, `nyc` & `standard` are available as dev dependencies.

A `build` workflow (see [here](./.github/workflows/build.yml)) is running on `pull request` and will execute your test suite before allowing you to merge your PR. It also has a `coverage` job already prepared that you can comment out as soon as your testing is in place and your `REPORTER_ID` is in the repository secrets. This is the ID on _Code Climate_ used for uploading code coverage reports.

Beside running your unit tests, this workflow also runs a static code analysis to find any vulnerability in your code. If a vulnerability is found, the workflow will directly fail and a notification will appear in the `Security` tab of your repository.

**Note:** a `analyze-code` workflow (see [here](./.github/workflows/analyze-code.yml)) is also in charge of performing a static code analysis on `push`. This ensure that vulnerabilities are catched even when pushing hotfixes.

# Documentation

This repository comes with a `generate-docs` workflow that generates documentation automatically for you based on your `action.yml`. See [here](https://github.com/kaskadi/action-generate-docs) and [there](./action.yml) for more information.

If you would like to see the workflow configuration, head [here](./.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml).

You can configure the template used to generate the action documentation [here](./docs/template.md)
