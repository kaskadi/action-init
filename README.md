on: [{YOUR-ACTION-EVENT}]
jobs:
  {YOUR-JOB-NAME}:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: {YOUR-STEP-NAME}
      uses: kaskadi/template-action@master
```

:point_down: **Here goes any extra details on how to use the action (environment variables/inputs description for example)** :point_down:

**Note:** everything contained in single curly brackets (`{ }`) needs to be replaced by your desired values
